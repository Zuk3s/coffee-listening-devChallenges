During the development of this project, I improved my ability to efficiently handle responsiveness, ensuring that the application adapts seamlessly to different devices and screen sizes. I also enhanced my skills in API usage, especially using the Fetch API to perform requests in an optimized and secure way, ensuring smooth integration of dynamic data. This process helped me better understand the importance of aligning aesthetics with functionality, resulting in a high-quality visual and interactive experience for users.

One of the challenges I faced during the project was designing the visuals using Tailwind CSS. However, with practice and by referring to the documentation, I quickly overcame this obstacle. Over time, I realized how Tailwind CSS can streamline the styling process and offer greater control over the design, which was essential for creating a modern and minimalist interface while staying true to the proposed design.
